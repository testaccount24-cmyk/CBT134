The #PDSTBL and @PRINTO members of this file originally (since 1989)
contained a modified version of the same-named members from CBT file
182 - the PDS command.  The intent was to slightly modify how PDS
processed REVIEW and PRINTOFF subcommands that specified a colon (:)
meaning "select all members".  The changes were to replace the
behavior of issuing the generated command against each member in turn
to issuing the command once for the whole data set.

The contents of these two members were cloned from PDS 8.3 but were
also applicable for PDS 8.4.  PDS 8.5 incorparated these changes into
the base code, and they remain in the current PDS 8.6 release.  As a
result, there is now no need to ship these members which became out of
date replicas of the current members of the PDS command package.
